# 🎯 FocusLabs

> *Because paying $15/month for a glorified checkbox app is not my vibe.*

## What is this?

FocusLabs is a sleek, no-nonsense habit tracker that I built after getting fed up with every other habit app on the market. You know the ones—cluttered interfaces, paywalls for basic features, and enough notifications to make you want to throw your phone into the ocean.

This is my personal solution: a beautiful, functional habit tracker that does exactly what I need, without the bloat or the subscription fees.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **📅 Week View Grid**: See all your habits at a glance with a clean, scrollable weekly grid
- **✅ One-Click Tracking**: Mark habits as complete or failed with satisfying visual feedback
- **⏰ Active Habit Tracker**: Real-time countdown showing your current habit with progress tracking
- **📊 Daily Overview**: Quick glance at upcoming habits and daily progress
- **🗓️ Calendar View**: Month-by-month visualization of your habit streaks and patterns

### The Good Stuff

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies because life's too short for legacy code:

- **React 19** - The latest and greatest
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development
- **Firebase** - Authentication (because I might want to sync across devices someday)
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons
- **Recharts** - Data visualization that doesn't make your eyes bleed
- **Canvas Confetti** - For those dopamine hits
- **DnD Kit** - Smooth drag-and-drop interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FocusLabs.git

# Navigate to the frontend
cd FocusLabs/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` and start building better habits!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Simple. Clean. Functional.**

No unnecessary animations that slow things down. No cluttered dashboards with 47 different metrics you'll never look at. No "premium" features locked behind a paywall.

Just a beautiful interface that helps you track your habits and stay consistent. That's it. That's the whole pitch.

## 🔮 Future Plans (Maybe)

- [ ] Cross-device sync (when I feel like setting up a backend)
- [ ] Habit analytics and insights
- [ ] Custom themes
- [ ] Export data to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Habit templates and suggestions
- [ ] Social accountability features (or maybe not, I like my privacy)

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Have a feature idea? Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. I built this for me, but if it helps you too, that's pretty cool.

## 📝 License

MIT - Do whatever you want with it. Build your own version. Sell it. I don't care. Just don't charge people $15/month for checkboxes.

## 💭 Why "FocusLabs"?

Because "YetAnotherHabitTracker" was taken, and this sounds like a place where productivity experiments happen. Which, honestly, is exactly what it is.

**Built with ☕ and mild frustration at the state of habit tracking apps.**

*If this app helps you build better habits, that's awesome. If it doesn't, well, at least you didn't pay for it.*
